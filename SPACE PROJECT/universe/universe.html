            <p>A universe is all of space and time and its contents, including planets, stars, galaxies, and all forms of matter and energy. Our observable universe is just a portion of the entire cosmos.</p>
            <p>The universe is inherintly fascinating, and it's mysterious phenomena have always fulled human curiosity, inspiring exploration and the quest to unevil it's secrets. The universe contains galaxies, contellations, planets and so on. The universe and it's phenomenon are as mysterious as deep sea. The size of the universe is unknown. The recent researches says that the universe is dynamic and has undergone dramatic changes.</p>
            <p>According to current scientific understanding, the universe began about 13.8 billion years ago with the Big Bang, a massive expansion from an extremely hot, dense point. Since then, the universe has been expanding, and it's still expanding today. This expansion explains why galaxies appear to be moving away from us the farther out we look. The universe is incredibly vast—so big that we can only observe a small portion of it, called the observable universe.</p>

            <p>The multiverse is a hypothetical group of multiple universes, including the one we live in. These universes may have different laws of physics, dimensions, and possibilities. The multiverse theory suggests that our universe may be just one of many—perhaps an infinite number—of universes that exist independently of one another. Each of these universes could have its own distinct laws of physics, constants, and conditions. This idea arises from various areas of theoretical physics and cosmology, especially when trying to explain the incredible fine-tuning of our universe, which seems perfectly set up to support life as we know it.</p>
            <p>One version of the multiverse comes from quantum mechanics, specifically the "many-worlds interpretation," which proposes that every possible outcome of a quantum event actually happens, each in its own separate universe. Another version comes from cosmic inflation theory, which suggests that during the rapid expansion after the Big Bang, different regions of space could have become isolated from each other, forming “bubble universes” with different physical properties. String theory also introduces the idea of multiple universes through the concept of extra dimensions and "branes," which are like floating universes in a higher-dimensional space.</p>
            <p>Though the multiverse is a compelling idea, it's still highly speculative and lacks direct observational evidence. Many scientists debate whether it’s a legitimate scientific hypothesis or a philosophical concept, since it may be impossible to test or observe other universes from within our own. However, it remains a fascinating framework for exploring the nature of reality, and it continues to inspire both scientific inquiry and the imagination of storytellers around the world. Few different types of universes are listed below:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Bubble Universes:</strong> Universes that form like bubbles in a cosmic foam.</li>
              <li><strong>Parallel Universes:</strong> Universes where alternate versions of ourselves might exist.</li>
              <li><strong>Brane Universes:</strong> Universes that exist on different membranes in higher dimensions.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Throughout the centuries, thinkers have proposed different explanations for the creation of the universe. Some cosmological thoughts were based on religious beliefs, while others were grounded in scientific explanations. In 1796 AD, French mathematician Pierre Simon de Laplace proposed that the sun and the planets were formed from a spinning cloud of gas called a nebula.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the 1900s, many scientists believed that the universe is static. According to this opinion, the universe remained basically unchanged, neither expanding nor contracting. The universe is infinitely large, and it existed forever.</p>
            <p>In 1915 AD, Albert Einstein proposed the theory of relativity, which was based on two principles:
            <ul>
              <li>No signal can travel faster than light.</li>
              <li>The laws of physics are the same everywhere in the universe for all the observers traveling at the same speed.</li>
            </ul>
            However, this could not be demonstrated in 1915, so Einstein altered his equation to describe a universe of constant size. Einstein's ideas made several different models of the universe possible, but all of them implied that the universe is expanding. In 1929 AD, American astronomer Edwin Hubble observed with the 100-inch Hooker telescope established on Mount Wilson and determined that all the galaxies beyond the Milky Way are moving away from the Earth, indicating the universe's expansion. He explained the relation between the velocity of galaxies and their inter-distance by plotting a graph. The relation is v = Hd where v is the velocity of galaxies, d is the distance, H is Hubble's constant. The value of Hubble's constant is 73 km/s/Mpc.</p>
            <p>The Big Bang theory is our best explanation for how the universe began. Astronomers describe the beginning of the universe through the Big Bang theory. According to this theory, the universe originated from a single point and then expanded and stretched, eventually reaching its current size and continuing to expand.</p>
            <p>In 1927, an astronomer named Georges Lemaitre had a big idea. He told that very long ago, the universe started just as a single point, a point at which a function takes an infinite value, especially in space-time when matter is infinitely dense, much like at the center of a black hole. He forwarded that the universe stretched and expanded to reach its current size, and it could continue to stretch. The universe is a vast space and has existed for an extensive period. Contemplating how it all began is challenging to imagine.</p>
            <p>Just two years later, Edwin Hubble observed that other galaxies were moving away from us. The galaxies farther away were moving faster than those closer to us. This discovery indicated that the universe was still expanding, just as Lemaitre had theorized. If things were moving apart, it meant that long ago, everything had been closer together.</p>
            <p>When the universe began, it consisted of hot, tiny particles mixed with light and energy, a stark contrast to its current form. Simply put, the universe originated from an infinitely hot and dense single point that inflated and stretched. Its expansion rate was initially extremely high, gradually becoming measurable.</p>

          <div class="section-content">
            <p>Current observations suggest that the expansion of the universe will continue forever. The prevailing theory is that the universe will cool as it expands, eventually becoming too cold to sustain life. For this reason, this future scenario, popularly called "Heat Death," is also known as the "Big Chill" or "Big Freeze." Some of the other popular theories include the Big Rip, Big Crunch, and the Big Bounce.</p>
            <p>If dark energy—represented by the cosmological constant, a constant energy density filling space homogeneously, or scalar fields, such as quintessence or moduli, dynamic quantities whose energy density can vary in time and space—accelerates the expansion of the universe, then the space between clusters of galaxies will grow at an increasing rate. Redshift will stretch ancient ambient photons (including gamma rays) to undetectably long wavelengths and low energies. Stars are expected to form normally for 10^12 to 10^14 (1–100 trillion) years, but eventually, the supply of gas needed for star formation will be exhausted. As existing stars run out of fuel and cease to shine, the universe will slowly and inexorably grow darker. According to theories that predict proton decay, the stellar remnants left behind will disappear, leaving behind only black holes, which themselves eventually disappear as they emit Hawking radiation. Ultimately, if the universe reaches thermodynamic equilibrium, a state in which the temperature approaches a uniform value, no further work will be possible, resulting in a final heat death of the universe.</p>
            <h3>There are three possible scenarios of this universe.</h3>

              <img src="OpenUniverse.jpg" alt="Open Universe" class="scenario-image">
              <img src="ClosedUniverse.jpg" alt="Closed Universe" class="scenario-image">

            <p>Fig (i) shows an open universe which has negative curvature, like a saddle. If the density is less than the critical density, the universe will keep expanding forever at an accelerating rate, but the geometry will be hyperbolic. In this model, the universe is infinite and will cool and spread out endlessly, leading to a "Big Freeze" or "Heat Death" scenario where stars burn out and galaxies drift apart into darkness.</p>
            <p>Fig (ii) shows a closed universe has positive curvature, like the surface of a sphere. In this model, if the density of the universe is greater than the critical density, gravity will eventually halt the expansion and cause the universe to collapse back on itself in a "Big Crunch." This scenario envisions a universe that is finite in size but without boundaries—like walking on the surface of Earth, you could keep going in one direction and eventually return to where you started.</p>
            <p>Fig (iii) shows a flat universe has zero curvature, meaning it follows the rules of Euclidean geometry (e.g., parallel lines never meet, and the angles of a triangle add up to 180°). In this model, the expansion of the universe slows down over time but never completely stops. The current consensus from measurements, like those from the Planck satellite and cosmic microwave background radiation, suggests that our universe is very close to flat, with a slight margin of error.</p>
